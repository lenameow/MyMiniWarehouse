Having stored too much food at home and forget how long the food could last? Unable to find the seasonings right when you need them? Finds it too much trouble to keep a record of your supplies? MyMiniWarehouse can help.

MyMiniWarehouse is an easy-to-use inventory management app that helps you manage food and other supplies at home. You may simply scan the barcode or record the item by its name. 

If you input more information like where the item is stored, you may search by its position later. 

If you record the item's best before date, you may set an alert that reminds you the item is near its expiry.
